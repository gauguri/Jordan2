# ShopLane (ASP.NET Core)

A modernised Jordan-themed e-commerce sample built with ASP.NET Core MVC. The application showcases a curated catalogue, session backed cart, and a lightweight in-memory checkout experience designed for demos and learning.

## Getting started

1. **Install the .NET SDK** (version 8.0 or later).
2. Restore dependencies and run the development server:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet run --project src/Jordan2.UI/Jordan2.UI.csproj
   ```

3. Navigate to `https://localhost:5001` (or the port shown in the console) to explore the storefront.

## Features

- ASP.NET Core MVC architecture with Razor views and reusable layout.
- In-memory catalogue and order repositories to stay self-contained.
- Session backed cart service with add, remove, clear, and checkout flows.
- Responsive UI tailored for the Jordan brand, including product galleries and order confirmation pages.
